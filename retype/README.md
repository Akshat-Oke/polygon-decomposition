# Polygon Decomposition

This project implements the polygon decomposition and merging algorithm described in "Algorithms for the decomposition of a polygon into convex polygons". Specifically, the `MP1` algorithm is used to decompose the non-convex polygon into convex polygons. These polygons are then merged to form and optimal decomposition consisting of the least number of convex polygons.
